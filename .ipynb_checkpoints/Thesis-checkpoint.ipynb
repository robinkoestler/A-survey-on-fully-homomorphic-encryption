    "## Fully homomorphic encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) has been a major field of research in the area of cryptography in recent years.\n",
    "In a simple notion, its objective can be described as performing operations on data, which itself is securely hidden in an encryption (ciphertext).\n",
    "For this reason, FHE features a broad range of applications, e.g. secure cloud computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two homomorphic operations, which are mainly considered, are additions and multiplications.\n",
    "This is sufficient since technically every deterministic algorithm can be expressed by NAND gates.\n",
    "A NAND gate for two bits $b_1,b_2 \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is defined as $\\mathrm{NAND}(b_1,b_2) = 1 - b_1b_2 \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and thus only requires one addition and one multiplication modulo 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the modern FHE approach relies on encryptions, which are based upon errors.\n",
    "These errors gradually increase during homomorphic operations and there is a bound in error size to which extent a correct decryption is still possible.\n",
    "Therefore we require a procedure of reducing an accumulated error to its initial size (comparable to a \"fresh\" encryption error), and in doing so, arbitrarily many homomorphic operations (FHE) become achievable.\n",
    "Gentry, who published the first FHE scheme in {cite}`gentry-fhe`, named this procedure bootstrapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more (historical) information about FHE see e.g. Section 6.1. in {cite}`a-decade-of-lattice-cryptography`."

    "## Summary of the thesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The thesis is organized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the rest of chapter 1, the {ref}`introduction`, we provide notation and implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Chapter 2, {ref}`ring-learning-with-errors`, we explore the framework of the state-of-the-art notion of (RLWE) ciphertexts.\n",
    "In doing so, we first investigate the properties of the ring $R$ and its modular arithmetic variants, which serve as plaintext/ciphertext spaces.\n",
    "We proceed to define a measure, i.e. $\\norm \\cdot$, to keep track of the \"size\" of ring elements, e.g. the errors required for encryptions.\n",
    "We also thoroughly analyse the probabilistic nature of $\\norm \\cdot$-bounds during adding/multiplying ring elements, as this later helps us to properly understand error growth in various contexts.\n",
    "Lastly, we give a decent overview of security terms and definitions connected to modern ring learning with errors cryptosystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Chapter 3, {ref}`the-BFV-scheme`, we examine the underlying encoding scheme (published in {cite}`BFV`), which provides algorithms for (secret/public) key-generation, encryption, decryption, addition and multiplication of ciphertexts.\n",
    "We especially focus on the error growth during the homomorphic operations, since these results heavily influence the overall running time, if one thinks of bootstrapping as an expensive intermission between performing additions/multiplications.\n",
    "For that matter, we derive a bound for correct decryption and analyse the performance (depending on the choice of parameters) computationally.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Chapter 4, {ref}`preparations-for-bootstrapping`, we establish methods to limit the error growth during multiplication, which is mandatory for our bootstrapping algorithm to be functional.\n",
    "To achieve this, we introduce alterations/extensions of the fundamental RLWE ciphertexts and analyse the corresponding algorithms.\n",
    "Furthermore, we investigate the two common auxiliary operations automorphism evaluation and rescaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Chapter 5, {ref}`bootstrapping`, we finally present the core algorithm (published in {cite}`boot`), which itself primarily contains the auxiliary part $\\texttt{scaled-mod}$, whose target is the realization of a non-trivial multiplication with a large constant.\n",
    "Splitting up the latter algorithm into three parts and also splitting up the problem into a large magnitude of subproblems will reveal, why bootstrapping is a computationally costly procedure after all.\n",
    "We conclude the description of the bootstrapping procedure by adapting it to the employed scheme of encoding, i.e. BFV.\n",
    "During the entire chapter, we will particularly emphasize a detailed error discussion, the (optimal) parameter selection, and the runtime analysis.\n",
    "As a proof of concept, we computationally review the bootstrapping scheme by verifying the correctness, inspecting the runtime, and rechecking the parameter selection.\n",
    "At last, we look into a simple application of fully homomorphic encryption, i.e. how to realize a more complex homomorphic operation, namely integer comparison e.g. used for the evaluation of if-statements.\n"

    "- With $\\round \\cdot$ (respectively $\\lceil \\cdot \\rceil$ and $\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor$) we denote the rounding function to the nearest integer (respectively up/down), which will be extended to polynomials coefficient-wise and to vectors entry-wise.\n",

    "The symbol ' will correspond to a $\\texttt{x}$ inside algorithms, e.g. $\\mathrm{RLWE'}$ becomes $\\texttt{rlwe-x}$.\n",

    "## Implementation details\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the bootstrapping scheme relies on the separate Python file \"polynomial\\_arithmetic.py\", which performs polynomial arithmetic and other useful operations on polynomials in {ref}`the-ring-R`. \n",
    "The framework of the Python file originates in {cite}`sarojaerabelli`, which has been partly modified and extended.\n",
    "The main motivation using it has been the lack of a (simple) Python package, which handles the arithmetic of arbitrary long integers as coefficients of polynomials in the above ring.\n",
    "The Python file includes extensive descriptions of its algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main contribution was the implementation of a faster multiplication algorithm, namely the Karatsuba algorithm, which contrary to the state-of-the-art multiplication techniques is simpler to implement from scratch and most importantly directly applicable to any ciphertext modulus $Q$ and ring degree $N$ (these parameters will be examined in {ref}`the-modular-variant-of-the-ring-R`).\n",
    "In the original file, i.e. in {cite}`sarojaerabelli`, the modern Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) multiplication algorithm is included, which is considerably faster compared to Karatsuba, but not applicable to powers of two as bootstrapping parameters (e.g. $Q$).\n",
    "Since powers of two greatly simplify the mathematical analysis of the scheme and furthermore implementing techniques and algorithm speed are not the main concerns of this thesis, we have chosen to omit FFT implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, multiplying efficiently is extremely important, since the bootstrapping procedure bases upon multiplications of polynomials.\n",
    "Apart from handling polynomials in the ring as a class object, we also import auxiliary functions, which generate polynomials, whose coefficients have certain properties, e.g. being drawn from a specific distribution (see {ref}`background-on-probability-theory`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Further inspiration for implementing the somewhat homomorphic BFV scheme in Python (see {ref}`the-BFV-scheme`) has been drawn from {cite}`bfv-implementation`.\n",
    "The full implementation, including an online jupyter book version of the thesis featuring executable code cells, can be found at [https://github.com/robinkoestler/A-survey-on-modern-fully-homomorphic-encryption](https://github.com/robinkoestler/A-survey-on-modern-fully-homomorphic-encryption). \n",
    "\n",
    "The bootstrapping implementation, which is split up among many auxiliary procedures throughout the document, will be analyzed in a step-by-step fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we import all necessary external Python packages and the class to handle polynomial arithmetic as $\\texttt{Poly}$.\n",
    "The variable $\\texttt{speed}$ linearly controls the running time and it may be augmented to obtain more precise computational results in the case of e.g. probabilistic bounds."

    "The above ring $R$ cannot possibly degenerate nonzero elements to zero during ring operations, but nevertheless, it contains infinitely many elements - a property we want to avoid while using a similar structure for message/ciphertext spaces.\n",
    "The introduction of a power of two modulus $M > 1$ to define the finite quotient ring $R_M := R/MR$ resolves this issue and has the following impacts:\n",
    "- Because of the finiteness, we are now able to choose elements of $R_M$ e.g. uniformly at random.\n",
    "This will later be necessary to define the \"Decision RLWE\" problem, upon which the security of our scheme is based.\n",
    "- To uniquely represent the coefficients of a polynomial in $R_M$, we will use the set of integers inside $(-M/2,M/2]$.\n",
    "Naturally, this is advantageous for two reasons.\n",
    "    - Firstly, it allows a coefficient to be sampled e.g. from a discrete normal distribution around zero.\n",
    "    - Secondly, compared to e.g. $[0,M-1]$ it halves the maximum absolute value a polynomial coefficient can reach and therefore is an optimal choice regarding the complexity of algorithms operating on integers.\n",
    "- By using different power of two moduli as $M$, we can adjust our plaintext/ciphertext/bootstrapping space size to our necessities.\n",
    "Switching between these will be easily done by just embedding (from small to large modulus) respectively by a modular reduction of the coefficients (and vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the use of modular variants of $R$, let us consider a small message space, e.g. $R_8$, and a larger (ciphertext) space, e.g. $R_{32}$, without a further specified $N$.\n",
    "Technically, we could just trivially embed an example message $2x+1 \\in R_8$ into the larger ring as $2x+1 \\in R_{32}$.\n",
    "But since we furthermore need to introduce additive errors, which make our scheme secure and also alter ring elements slightly, we can use a different, more sophisticated embedding into $R_{32}$ than just enlarging the space in general.\n",

    "We observe that instead of irrevokably changing the message by adding $e$ to $2x+1$ in $R_8$, we made use of the larger ring $R_{32}$ in such a way, that it preserves the message when adding $e$ in $R_{32}$ and switching back to $R_8$ afterwards.\n",
    "This later becomes a crucial idea in the bootstrapping procedure, where errors are \"large\".\n",
    "The above procedure also highlights that power of two moduli $M$ generally result in integer $\\kappa$'s, which keeps the upscaling by $\\kappa$ clean from rounding errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum it up, we gain security and sizing control by adding modular arithmetic to $R$.\n",
    "However, it should be remarked that $R_M$ for powers of two $M>2$ and $N$ is no longer an integer domain.\n",

    "2. It is important to note, that in {cite}`hardness-for-any-modulus` it has been proven that the security of Decision-RLWE does not rely on specific number of theoretical properties of the modulus $Q$ and hence we conveniently can set $Q$ to be a large power of two.\n",

    "It can be shown that we even may assume $s \\sim \\chi$ without changing the above theorem (see Section 4.4.1 in {cite}`a-decade-of-lattice-cryptography`).\n",

    "Some of these will later be considered during {ref}`preparations-for-bootstrapping`, which underlines the relevance of multiplication for the entire FHE scheme.\n",

    "\n",
    "Although we will use multiplication for the more general notion of RLWE ciphertexts later as well, we will first stick to the BFV case.\n",
    "For simplicity, and according to our implementation with powers of two $T<Q$, we will drop the rounding of $\\round{Q/T}$ from now on. \n",
    "Taking two BFV ciphertexts of their form $(a_i,-a_i\\cdot s + e_i + (Q/T) M_i)$ for messages $M_0,M_1$, we immediately observe that it is mandatory for a BFV multiplication algorithm to multiply the second components $-a_i\\cdot s + e_i + (Q/T) M_i$, yielding a term including $M_0M_1$.\n",
    "Because the additive structure is not compatible with multiplication in a linear way, we can already presume that we will obtain several summands, which are dispensable and, in the error case, even obstructive for further operations on ciphertexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, if we denote the BFV ciphertexts as $(a_0,b_0)$ and $(a_1,b_1)$, the multiplication $b_0b_1$ yields the following nine summands, which we will need to somehow regroup into three (a secret key component, an error and one containing the hidden $M_0M_1$) of a regular BFV ciphertext:\n",

    "Since it is crucial for any advanced computer program to handle if-statements, we state a basic algorithm, which checks if $a \\ge b$ in ciphertext space and gives the answer in an encrypted binary form.\n",
    "This method is due to Section 4.B in {cite}`homomorphic-comparison`.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, given two (BFV) ciphertexts $C_a$ and $C_a$ including the hidden messages $a, b \\in \\Z$, the algorithm outputs a ciphertext $C_0$ containing the message $0$ (i.e. true), if $a \\ge b$, and otherwise $C_1$ (i.e. false).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to compare the difference $a-b$ with zero since this works for arbitrary $a$ and $b$.\n",
    "Therefore we select a prime $p$, such that $p/2 \\ge \\abs{a} + \\abs{b}$, because then $a-b \\in (-p/2,p/2]$.\n",
    "Now, for all integers $y$ in $(-p/2,p/2]$, we determine the polynomial in $l(y) \\in (\\Z/p\\Z)[y]$ of degree $p-1$, which satisfies $f(y) = 0 \\mod p$, if $y \\ge 0$, and $f(y) = 1 \\mod p$, if $y < 0$.\n",
    "This can be done by Lagrange interpolation followed by a modular reduction by $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, we now define our result ciphertext as $l(C_a - C_b) = l(C_{a-b})$, which can be evaluated by the (BFV) scheme's homomorphic addition/multiplication operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we implement a homomorphic comparison example with $a,b \\in {-1,0,1}$ and $p = 5$.\n",
    "Thus we have $l(y) = 3y^4+3y^3-y$ in this case."
