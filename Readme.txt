To use the jupyter book version of the thesis, do the following:

1. Download the whole repository from GitHub.
2. Open the file _build/_page/Thesis/html/Thesis.html in an Internet browser (internet connection required)

To enable executable code cells, click the rocket on top of the jupyter book (view in browser as described above) and select „Live Code“.
Do not forget to toggle the „speed“ parameter (i.e. set speed = 1) in the first code cell to enable real-time computations.
